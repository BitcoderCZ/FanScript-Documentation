@name:Inline
@info:- When applied to variable - instead of storing a value stores a reference to some code, which is ran every time the variable is accesed.\n- When applied to function - inlines the function for every call \(by default functions which are called only once are inlined automatically\) - replaces calls to this function by the code of this function.
